# Ergohaven Firmware Profile

K:04 Series is the reference profile for Ergohaven RMK firmware. Production
profiles share this software contract:

- 16 layers
- 32 combos, up to 4 keys each
- 32 Morse / Tap Dance entries, up to 8 patterns each
- 2048 bytes of macro storage
- 8 forks
- 5 Bluetooth profiles
- protocol bulk size 8 and macro chunk size 64 bytes
- Bluetooth reconnect and pairing windows of 60 seconds
- persistent layer names at QSID 200–215, up to 12 UTF-8 bytes each
- firmware version 0.1.5 and manufacturer `Ergohaven`

Standard keyboard profiles expose the factory layer names `Base`,
`Navigation`, `Symbols`, and `Adjust`. Layer 4 is `Mouse` only on keyboards
that have the pointing layer there; otherwise it is `4`. Layers 5–15 use their
decimal indices. User-defined names remain authoritative.

Every Ergohaven profile compiles layers 5–15 as `No`, not `Transparent`, so
Entropy displays those factory layers as empty instead of inheriting keys from
lower layers. Layers 0–4 keep their existing keymaps. Velvet uses one firmware
for both hardware variants: the ordinary right thumb key remains in the matrix,
while an optional PMW3610 occupies that position on the pointing variant.
Layers 5 and 6 can still select Scroll and Sniper pointing modes, but their
factory keymaps contain only `No`.

Saved key and encoder actions on layers 0–4 remain in the established V2
storage namespace. Legacy V2 records for layers 5–15 are ignored so the new
factory `No` actions take effect without a settings reset. New edits on layers
5–15 use a separate V3 tail namespace and continue to persist normally.

Split pairing uses a 30-second window. Standalone split centrals sleep after
120 seconds; powered Qube centrals use 900 seconds. Entropy capability metadata
advertises separate half batteries on all split devices and time/media live
features only where Qube supplies them.

Hardware-specific differences remain in matrices, pins, encoder count,
pointing devices, displays, lighting, batteries, and split topology.

## USER keycode compatibility

Classic firmware keeps the established USER00–USER09 numeric mapping so saved
layouts remain valid. The names are standardized as `BT0`–`BT4`, `BT_NEXT`,
`BT_PREV`, `BT_CLR`, `BT_TOG`, and `BT_PEER`.

K:04 retains its established numeric mapping and its larger named USER set.
RMK's Ergohaven processor accepts both mappings. Renumbering either mapping
requires an explicit saved-layout migration and is outside this compatibility
stage.

## Storage and reset

All production nRF52840 profiles reserve the same 128 KiB settings partition
at `0xCC000–0xEC000`. Application linkers stop at `0xCC000`, preventing
firmware and settings from overlapping.

Use `settings_reset.uf2` for keyboard halves and `settings_reset_qube.uf2` for
a Qube dongle. Both erase only the unified partition; separate files are
required because the application origins differ.

Profiles upgrading from the legacy `0xA0000–0xC0000` partition can preserve
their raw settings by running the matching one-time storage migration utility
before flashing the new firmware.

The former Velvet UI profile used a separate USB identity (`0x00BF`) and a
different saved-keymap shape. Before its first upgrade to the unified Velvet
firmware (`0x00BE`), reset both halves with `settings_reset.uf2`, remove the
old Velvet UI Bluetooth pairing on the host, and pair again. Existing standard
Velvet installations already use the unified identity and do not need this
one-time reset.

Run `./scripts/check_ergohaven_profile.sh` to reject accidental profile drift.
